TASKS COMPLETED:

Dataset Selection
Select a dataset that aligns with your interests and objectives for the text analysis. Consider the following criteria:
Ensure the dataset is relevant to your area of study or interest.
Choose a dataset that is readily accessible and publicly available, preferably in a format suitable for analysis (e.g., CSV or Excel).
Consider the size of the dataset and whether it is manageable for your analysis purposes.
Assess the quality of the dataset in terms of completeness, accuracy and reliability.

Data Collection 
Collect a text dataset suitable for classification. This could be news articles categorized by topic, spam vs. non-spam emails, product reviews categorized by sentiment, etc.
Provide a brief description of the dataset, including its source, size number of classes and any relevant characteristics.

Text Pre-Processing 
Perform the following pre-processing steps on the collected text data:
Convert text to lowercase.
Remove punctuation.
Perform tokenization.
Remove stop words.
Perform text normalization (stemming or lemmatization).

Data Exploration 
Conduct exploratory analysis to understand the distribution of classes in the dataset.
Visualize the data using appropriate charts (such as bar charts or word clouds).
Provide insights based on the data exploration.

Baseline Text Classification Model 
Implement a baseline text classification model using a simple algorithm such as Naive Bayes.
Vectorize the text data using techniques such as bag-of-words (BoW) or TF-IDF.
Train and evaluate the model using appropriate metrics (examples: accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score).

Advanced Machine Learning Models 

Implement more advanced machine learning models such as logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM) or random forest.
Compare the performance of these models using the same vectorization techniques.
Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics and perform cross-validation.

Deep Learning Based Text Classification

Implement a deep learning-based text classification model using neural network algorithms.
Use word embeddings (such as Word2Vec or GloVe) to represent the text data.
Train and evaluate the model using appropriate metrics.

Model Comparison and Analysis 

Compare the performance of the baseline models, advanced machine learning models and deep learning models.
Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.
Discuss any challenges faced during the implementation and how they were addressed.
